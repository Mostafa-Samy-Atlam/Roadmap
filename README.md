# Roadmap
Before we have a talk about roadmap of how to be a good AI engineer, we must first answer the following question???
-  What Does an AI Engineer Do?
## Roadmap: Roles and Responsibilities of an AI Engineer
- Building AI models from scratch and assisting product managers and stakeholders with analysis and implementation 
- Developing and maintaining AI infrastructures and product development
- Performing statistical analysis and interpreting the results to guide and optimize the company’s decision-making
- Automating the infrastructure used by the data science team
- Transforming machine learning models into APIs that can be integrated with other applications
- Training and retraining systems when necessary
- Running AI and machine learning experiments and tests
- Collaborating and coordinating tasks with other teams to promote AI adoption and best practices
## Roadmap: What Skills Should an AI Engineer Have?
- Learn programming languages - Proficiency in object-oriented programming languages like Python, C#, or C++ is needed to become an AI engineer.
- An understanding of frameworks like Keras and Tensorflow to build AI solutions
- Ability to build deep learning algorithms using neural networks — familiarity with CNNs and RNNs
- Familiarity with cloud platforms like Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, or Microsoft Azure — you should be able to deploy and scale models using these platforms.
- An understanding of software development methodologies like Agile or Scrum
-	Experience with cloud computing
-	Knowledge of Data science, data wrangling, and big data.
## Roadmap: Basic Computer Science Skills
1. Consider obtaining a degree in a related field, as AI engineering requires a strong educational background. Typically, AI engineers hold a bachelor’s degree in computer science, data science, mathematics, or a related discipline. While it isn’t always required, a master’s degree in these AI-related fields can prove beneficial. 
- Typically, you must learn computer science basics. What is bits and bytes and how RAM and CPU works. The fundamental of computer science.

## Roadmap: Model Deployment
### Model Deployment:
- After learning the topics mentioned above, you will can build AI applications from scratch. Now, you need to be able to deploy these applications and scale them. To do this, you need to learn how to put models in production with popular cloud platforms — Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Pick any of these three platforms and start learning how to deploy models on them. Cloud computing is an essential skill for an AI engineer to have, so make sure to gain as much experience as possible in using these platforms.
- This would take us to MLOPS, you should be good at one of the MLOPS frameworks.

If you are interested in AWS platform, you can study one of the following 3 courses. All of these courses are about Amazon SageMaker which is a fully managed machine learning service that an help developers to build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment easily and quickly.

## Roadmap: Large Language Models: LLMS
- Language models (LMs) work by learning the statistical patterns and relationships within language data. They are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.
- Here's a general overview of how language models work:
	1.	Training data: Language models are trained on large amounts of text data, which can include books, articles, websites, and other sources of written language. The training data is used to expose the model to a wide range of language patterns and structures.
	2.	Tokenization: The text data is divided into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, subwords, or characters, depending on the specific tokenization approach used. Tokenization helps the model process and understand the text.
	3.	Model architecture: Language models are typically built using deep learning architectures. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were commonly used in the past, but transformer-based architectures, such as the one used in the GPT models, have gained popularity due to their superior performance.
	4.	Pre-training: The language model is then pre-trained on the tokenized text data. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence of words based on the context provided by the preceding words. This process allows the model to learn the statistical patterns and dependencies in the training data.
	5.	Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the language model can be further fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a more specific dataset related to the target task. This process helps the model adapt its learned representations to the particular task at hand.
	6.	Inference and generation: Once the language model is trained, it can be used for various tasks. During inference, the model takes input text and generates output text based on the learned patterns and context. This can involve generating completions for partial sentences, answering questions, or generating creative text based on a given prompt.
